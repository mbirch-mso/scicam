The latest documentation is located at

	http://www.edt.com/manuals/PCD/time-dist.pdf#view=FitV,0

To test the board after installation, connect an IRIG-B signal to
the LIMO connector and run:

	initpcd -f pcd_config/spi.cfg
	timing_test

At the timing_test prompt, give the command "t 10" to capture
10 one-second timestamps, or "t 0" to capture one-second timestamps
indefinitely.
