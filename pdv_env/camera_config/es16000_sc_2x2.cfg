# serial_init string is string to send to camera to put it into

# serial_term is terminating char to be tacked on at the end of all
# serial commands (by serial_term (here) AND serial_cmd command line
# program, AND pdv_serial_command() library subroutine.

# serial_baud defaults to 9600 but can be set otherwise.

# as of v4.1.3.6 and later, pclock_speed (camera pixel clock speed)
# can be put in configs and will be used by the library to bias the auto
# timeout to a more reasonable value; very handy for large format
# cameras to avoid really long timeout waits. also can be used for
# application hints (app can access it at it as dd_p->pclock_speed)
