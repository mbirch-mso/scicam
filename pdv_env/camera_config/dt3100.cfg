# 0-3: number of bits per pixel - 1

CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             27

# camera link config register bits:
# 0: RGB (set for RGB on older/PCI, n/a for newer/PCIe)
# 1: ignore data valid
# 2: line scan
# 3: disable ROI
# 4: undefined
# 5: data valid invert
# 6-7: undefined

CL_CFG_NORM:                   01

# mode control register bits:
# 0-3: on/off state of mode control lines
# 4-7: which mode control line to send expose pulse for
#      triggered exposure or pulse-width triggering.
# this directive is usually set to 00 for free-running cameras,
# or 10 for triggered or pulse-width cameras/modes
#
MODE_CNTL_NORM:                00

# region of interest:
# NOTE: on the evaluation camera that EDT tested, first line has an initial
# short line valid resulting in a partial first line and shifted image.
# Region of interest used to skip first line fixes it but this should
# probably be fixed in the camera in order to capture all 1080 lines
