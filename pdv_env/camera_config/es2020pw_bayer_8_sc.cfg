# serial_baud defaults to 9600 but can be set otherwise
# serial_term is terminating char to be tacked on at the end of all
# serial commands (by serial_term (here) AND serial_cmd command line
# program, AND pdv_serial_command() library subroutine 
# serial_init string is string to send to camera to put it into
# a known state. See camera mfg. documentation for specific serial
# commands for this camera. the commands here are, in order:
#   trigger mode: level (pulse width)
#   trigger polarity: positive
#   trigger input: cameralink
#   trigger state: on
#   sensor tap readout 449: 1 (40 Mhz)
#   bit window: top 8 bits
#   binning mode: off
