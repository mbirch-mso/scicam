camera_class:                  "Infrared Components Corporation"
camera_model:                  "MBC200 Series (MBC2XX)"
camera_info:                   "14 bit"

# This configuration should be used to grab the full 14 bits of information:
# 12 bits - Data magnitude     Bits 0 - 11 
#  1 bit  - Sign               Bit 12
#  1 bit  - Bad pixel flag     Bit 13

# Note: The bad pixel bit is bit 15 at the camera, but wired to bit 13 of the grabber

# Note: After a calibration/normalization,
#       pixel data for targets warmer than the cal source will be positive values: 0000  up  to 0FFF
#       pixel data for targets cooler than the cal source will be negative values: 1FFF down to 1000

#       Any "bad pixels" will be flagged by bit 15 being set: 2XXX
