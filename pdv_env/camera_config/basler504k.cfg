# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #channels
# bits 0-3: number of bits per pixel minus 1
# bits 4-7: number of channels (taps) minus 1

CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             97

# camera link config register bits
# (argument is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes

#   test pattern OFF: a10100, or ON: a10101

# too fast (too short of an intrframe gap) for normal ops; so we don't do interrupts except
# for the first one, and instead just read in whenever FVAL is high. disadvantage is that
# the driver won't detect underruns/issue timeouts, leading to a persistently out-of-synch
# condition if underruns occur. the good news: now we have method_framesync (see next)
#
fv_once:	1

# new as of 5.3.9.6 and later, uncomment the next directive to check for synch via IRIG2
# header data; lets us detect underruns and get a timeout even in continuous or fv_once mode

#method_framesync: EMULATE_TIMEOUT
