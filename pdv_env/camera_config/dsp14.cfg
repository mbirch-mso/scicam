# for this camera, the ROI registers are used for exposure control.
# hskip is the number of clocks for exposure (microseconds * 40) / line
# hactv is the number of clocks for exposure (microseconds * 40) / line
# total = 33 microseconds * 40
#
# IMPORTANT: THIS WILL CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, so be sure not to use this
# version of the config file with future versions of the software -- in
# particular, future versions of aiag.bit. This version is shipped with 
# v3.2.1.6, will probably change by v3.2.1.7 or .8
