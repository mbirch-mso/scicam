# DVFOX/RCX C-Link defaults to 24-bit packing across the fiber. For
# most cameras that's optimal, however for >60 MHz OR serial rates
# > 19.2kbaud, need to use 16 bit mode. in this case we have the
# high serial baud rate so need to run in 16-bit mode. setting
# this flag will do that on both the RCX C-Link and FOX

# region of interest start and area (optional)
# vskip/hskip is how many pixels to skip before ROI, vert and horiz
# vactv/hactv is how many pixels to DMA to memory after skip, vert and horiz
# if full frame is desired, you can leave these commented out or make them the
# same as the camera width/height. hskip/hactv can also be used to trim columns
# for cameras that output non-4-byte-aligned data to multiple of 4 bytes (in
# width) to ensure proper operation of windows applications that depend on
# 4-byte alignment, e.g. pdvshow
