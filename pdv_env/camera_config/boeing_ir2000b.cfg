interlace: 240

# shift register bits (hex):
# 0-3: value to barrel-shift data bits if cable not wired straight-thru
# 4: do aia swap of data bits end for end

shift:			00

# mask register bits (hex):
# any bits NOT set will be set to 0 in image
# set to match depth of camera

# mode control register bits (hex):
# 0-3: on/off state of mode control lines
# 4-7: which mode control line to send expose pulse for
