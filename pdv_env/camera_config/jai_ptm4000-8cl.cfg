# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel need to set one or the other to 2
# depending on whether the two pixels/clock are both on the same line
# or adjacent lines. In this case they're both the same line, so, htaps.
# (This is just for the region of interest flags -- either vskip/vactv
# or hskip/hactv needs to be halved when running dual channel, this is how
# we know which.)
