# serial_mode bits (MC4 in UTIL2 register) for PCI DVA with straight thru
# serial (no RS232-RS422 converter in the cable) only applicable to PCI DVA,
# should be benign on DV, DVK, RCI, etc. BUT if using PCI DVA with 422 version
# of the cable (has the black box), method_serial_mode should be commented
# out and board should be jumpered for RS422 serial (see users guide)
#
method_serial_mode:            RS232

# these set up the registers on the board and variables in the driver

# NOTE: ROI will NOT work with rev 11 or earlier PCI DVK or rev 20
# or earlier PCI DV. in that case you'll need to comment these out
# and also use HWPAD and change the width as appropriate to put
# the width on a 4 pixel boundary
