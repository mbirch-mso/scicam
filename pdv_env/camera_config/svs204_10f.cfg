# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #channels
# bits 0-3: number of bits per pixel minus 1
# bits 4-7: number of channels (taps) minus 1

CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             09

# camera link config register bits
# (arg is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv lines if bit 4 is set, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines if bit 2 is also set, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   02

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to
# set either htaps or vtaps to 2. Typcially it's htaps but depends on whether
# the two pixels that come out with each clock are both on the same line
# (uncomment htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2) 
#
#htaps:	2
#vtaps: 	2

# interlace / reorder method
# only for interleaved and some dual tap cameras
# determines how image is deinterleaved for display -- WORD_INTLV is only
# one of many available methods -- see *_INTLV in pdv_dependent.h and
# camera configuration guide for more
#
#method_interlace:	WORD_INTLV

# the following directives can be used to send us any serial commands
# necessary to put the camera to put it into the expected state.
# serial_init takes a colon-separated list of ASCII commands, and should
# be used for cameras that use an ASCII serial command set. serial_binit
# takes space-separated groups of hex bytes, for cameras that use binary
# serial instead of ASCII; each group gets send as a separate command with
# a serial_read of the response (thrown away) between each.  Examples of
# commands that should be sent include those that put the camera into the
# desired trigger mode (e.g. continuous, triggered, controlled), #bits and
# taps, etc. The idea is to set the camera mode to match how the rest
# of the config directives are setting up the FG board.
#
# spec is vague on serial for this camera and default is freerun so the following
# best guess at command to set freerun is left commented out for now

#serial_init: "M0x00"

# Serial termination Character
# defines the termination character(s) that will be sent after each
# serial command sent by the library subroutine pdv_serial_command, including
# those sent by serial_init (above).  If no serial_term is specified, the
# default, carriage return character (0d hex) will be sent. If some other
# sequence is needed, uncomment serial_term and insert the appropriate hex
# byte(s) separated by spaces.  serial_term only applies to EDT's
# ASCII-specific serial directives (e.g. serial_init) and library subroutines
# (pdv_serial_command),
# NOT binary ones (serial_binit, pdv_serial_binary_command).  To specify no
# serial terminator, call serial_term with an empty list <>
#
#serial_term: <0d>


# Mode Control register (hex)
# Hex value -- the left-most nibble determines which CC line is toggled for
# the EXPOSE pulse (if method_camera_shutter_timing is other than AIA_SERIAL).
# The right-most nibble determines which of the CC lines are held permanently
# high or low.  Typically this is set automatically by merthod_camera_timing
# (to 10 hex for triggered and MCL modes, 00 otherwise).  However if your
# camera needs it set otherwise, use this directive to do so.
#
# MODE_CNTL_NORM: 10

# DVFOX fiber-optic boards with RCX C-Link defaults to 24-bit packing across the
# fiber. For most cameras that's optimal, however for 10-16 bit cameras with pixel
# clock rates above 40 and up to 60Mhz, OR serial rates > 19.2kbaud, we need to
# use 16 bit mode. Un-commenting this directive will do that if you're using a
# FOX board. If you're using a non-fiber board such as the PCI DV C-Link or
# PCIe8 DV C-link, this flag is ignored.
#
#mode16: 1

# Region of Interest start and area (decimal)
# vskip/hskip is how many pixels to skip before ROI, vert and horiz
# vactv/hactv is how many pixels to DMA to memory after skip, vert and horiz
# if full frame is desired, you can leave these commented out or make them the
# same as the camera width/height. hskip/hactv can also be used to trim columns
# for cameras that output non-4-byte-aligned data to multiple of 4 bytes (in
# width) to ensure proper operation of windows applications that depend on
# 4-byte alignment, e.g. pdvshow
#
#hskip: 0
#hactv: 1024
#vskip: 0
#vactv: 768
