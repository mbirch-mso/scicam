# note: on the dv and dvk, aiag_2ch is just a copy of aiag, and the
# DUAL_CHANNEL flag selects dual channel operation. On the dva and fox
# however, dual channel is handled with a different bitfile.  This
# scheme makes everything compatible.

# mode control register bits (hex):
# 0-3: on/off state of mode control lines

# board controlled timing (AIA_MCL) enables on-board shutter timer
# which is 0-255 with 10x and 100x bits, thus 0-25500 millisecond
# range (used by applications only, to determine width of sliders,
# etc -- see pdv_get_min_shutter, pdv_get_max_shutter)

# shift register bits (hex):
# 0-3: value to barrel-shift data bits if cable not wired straight-thru
