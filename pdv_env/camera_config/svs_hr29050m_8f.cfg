# rbtfile specifies the FPGA file to be loaded (almost always aiag.bit), for
# boards that have a separate UI FPGA.  Newer boards (PCIe, Camera Link)
# employ a single combined PCIe/UI FPGA; this directive will be ignored in
# those cases. Nevertheless, an rbtfile should be specified in case the config
# ever gets used with a board that needs it.
#
rbtfile: aiagcl.bit

# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #taps
# bits 0-3: number of bits per pixel minus 1
# bits 4-7: number of taps minus 1
#
CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             37	# 4 tap, 8 bit

# camera link config register bits
# (argument is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv lines if bit 4 is set, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines if bit 2 is also set, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   02
