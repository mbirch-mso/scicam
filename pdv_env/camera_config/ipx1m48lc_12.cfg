# camera link data path register bits (hex):
# 0-3: number of bits per pixel - 1
# 4-7: number of channels - 1
#
CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             1b

# camera link config register bits (hex):
# 0: RGB (on for RGB color [exc. bayer] cameras only)
# 1: ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2: line scan
# 3: disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4: unused
# 5: data valid invert (rare)
# 6-7: undefined
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   0

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to set
# either htaps or vtaps to 2. Which one depends on whether the two pixels
# that come out with each clock are both on the same line (uncomment
# htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2) 
#
htaps:	2

# interlace method
# only for interleaved and some dual channel cameras
# determines how image is deinterleaved for display -- BYTE_INTLV is only
# one of many available methods -- see *_INTLV in pdv_dependent.h and
# camera configuration guide for more
