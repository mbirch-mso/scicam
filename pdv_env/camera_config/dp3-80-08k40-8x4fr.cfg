# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #channels

# camera link config register bits
# (argument is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# Bit# Hex  Description
#  0  (01): RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
#  1  (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
#  2  (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv (if 10 is set), for linescan
#  3  (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
#  4  (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv (height) lines, for linescan
#  5  (20): data valid invert (rare)
#  6  (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
#  7  (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes

# sem 2, 7 or 8 (freerun) or sem 6 (triggered)
# clm 15 (8 bit 4 tap), or clm 21 (8 bit 8 tap)

# Mode Control register (hex)
# Hex value -- the left-most nibble determines which CC line is toggled for
# the EXPOSE pulse (if method_camera_shutter_timing is other than AIA_SERIAL).
# The right-most nibble determines which of the CC lines are held permanently
# high or low.  Typically this is set automatically by merthod_camera_timing
# (to 10 hex for triggered and MCL modes, 00 otherwise).  However if your
# camera needs it set otherwise, use this directive to do so.
#
# MODE_CNTL_NORM: 10

# Region of Interest start and area (decimal)
# hskip /hactv is how many pixels to skip / how many active
# pixels per line. for linescan, vactv is how many lines to capture
# if commented out and ROI not disabled, vactv will be set to width (above).
