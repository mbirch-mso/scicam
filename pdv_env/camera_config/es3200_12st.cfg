# Redlake es3200 
#
# NOTE: the 3200 (and 1602/3) are single-tap only cameras, and require
# a trigger. self-triggered mode (6) can be used (this config) but be careful --
# the camera's mechanical shutter will go forever and wear itself out
# eventually

# Camera link config register bits (arg is a 2-digit hex value):
# 0 (0x01): RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)

# 2 (0x04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL, for line scan cameras

# 4 (0x10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines, for line scan cameras
# 5 (0x20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (0x40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
