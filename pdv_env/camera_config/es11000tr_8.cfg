# camera link data path register bits (hex):

# as of v4.1.3.6 and later, pclock_speed (camera pixel clock speed)
# can be put in configs and will be used by the library to bias the auto
# timeout to a more reasonable value; very handy for large format
# cameras to avoid really long timeout waits. also can be used for
# application hints (app can access it at it as dd_p->pclock_speed)
