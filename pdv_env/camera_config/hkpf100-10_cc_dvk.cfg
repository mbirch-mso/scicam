# board xilinx firmware -- usually aiag.bit, but for Hitachi
# dual triger/frame on demand we use this special one. Note
# that it's different  (kp_f100.bit) for DV vs DVK due to
# differences in the way the cable is wired.

# mode control register bits (hex):
# 0-3: on/off state of mode control lines
# 4-7: which mode control line to send expose pulse for
#      triggered exposure or pulse-width triggering.
# this directive is usually set to 00 for free-running cameras,
