# serial_baud defaults to 9600 but can be set otherwise
# serial_init string is string to send to camera to put it into
# a known state. See camera mfg. documentation for specific serial
# commands for this camera. the commands in this case are, in order:
#   trigger mode 404: level (pulse width)
#   trigger polarity 402: positive
#   trigger input 408: cameralink
#   trigger state 406: on
#   sensor tap readout 449: 1 (40 Mhz)
#   binning mode 248: off
