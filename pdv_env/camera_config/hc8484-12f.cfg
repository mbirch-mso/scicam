# NOTE: C8484 gain takes L or H as an argument to the CEG command, as opposed
# to a numeric value like the 4742-95. So instead of using a serial_gain:
# directive (which implies a numeric argument), we coded it into the library
# -- sending a pdv_serial_gain(0) translates to CEG L, sending 1 translates
# to CEG H.
