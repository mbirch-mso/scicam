# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_CFG_NORM) we need to set
# either htaps or vtaps to 2. Which one depends on whether the two pixels
# that come out with each clock are both on the same line (uncomment
# htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2)

# only for interleaved and some dual channel cameras
