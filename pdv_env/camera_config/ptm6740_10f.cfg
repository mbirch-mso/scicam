CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             19

# camera link config register bits (hex):
# 0: RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
# 1: ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to
# set either htaps or vtaps to 2. Which one depends on whether the two pixels
# that come out with each clock are both on the same line (uncomment
# htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2) 
#
htaps:	2
#vtaps: 2

# interlace method
# only for interleaved and some dual channel cameras
# determines how image is deinterleaved for display -- BYTE_INTLV is only
# one of many available methods -- see *_INTLV in pdv_dependent.h and
# camera configuration guide for more
#
#method_interlace:	WORD_INTLV
