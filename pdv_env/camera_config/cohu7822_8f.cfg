camera_class:                  "Cohu"
camera_model:                  "7822"
camera_info:                   "1280x1024, 8-bits freerun"

# actual width/height (total pixels) and depth of data from camera
# to only grab high 8-bits, set depth to 8 but leave extdepth set
# to actual depth, and adjust shift and mask accordingly
#
width:                         1280
height:                        1024
depth:                         8
extdepth:                      8

# rbtfile is ignored for std camera link board but needed
# for DV FOX (fiberoptic) (v3.3.4.9 or later)
#
rbtfile: aiagcl.bit

# camera link data path register bits (hex):
# 0-3: number of bits per pixel - 1
# 4-7: number of channels - 1
#
CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             07

# camera link config register bits (hex):
# 0: RGB (on for RGB color cameras only)
# 1: ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2: line scan
# 3: disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4: unused
# 5: data valid invert (rare)
# 6: undefined
# 7: enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
#
CL_CFG_NORM:                   02

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_CFG_NORM) we need to set
# either htaps or vtaps to 2. Which one depends on whether the two pixels
# that come out with each clock are both on the same line (uncomment
# htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2) 
#
htaps:	1
