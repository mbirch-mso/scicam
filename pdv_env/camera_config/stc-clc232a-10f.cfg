# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):

# camera link config register bits
# (arg is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
