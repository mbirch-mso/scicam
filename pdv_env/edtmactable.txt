# mac address calculation details for EDT devices
# used as input for pciload & other applicable devices
#
# format: device_name type_number prefix offset count
#
# - device_name: informational
# - type_number: specific type number for each board; see wiki (edt internal)
# - prefix: is the part of the serial number that is not used in the calculation
# - offset: offset for macaddr calculation
# - count: number of macaddrs assigned to this device
#
# EDT OUI (left 24 bits) is 00251c, the type number is the next 8 bits, and
# the rest (right 16 bits) are calculated, as follows:
#
#     00251C << 24 | type_num << 16 | offset * (sn * multiplier) + 0..count-1
#
# to produce count macaddrs

# note: LCR blades have been removed from this table since a) this (older, more
# rudimentary) format doesn't include all needed fields to determine their macaddr
# types correctly, and b) this file is only used by pciload, which isn't used
# to program LCR devices anyway (see lcr/cpp/sidebandbus/SbbPartXref.h)
