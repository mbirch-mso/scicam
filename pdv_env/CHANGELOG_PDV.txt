Change Log for EDT PCI DV Software/Driver Package
=================================================

(For Linux device drivers, see also CHANGELOG_LINUX.txt and README.lnx.pkg.reqs)

Version Notes
  * NOTE: Windows Versions 5.x are the new WDF drivers, designed for Win XP/32,
    Vista/32&64 Win7/32&64. Always use a 5.x driver for Vista or Win7/8/10 or
    any new installation
  * Linux  Versions 5.x use our updated package build and support the latest
    Linux kernels

BE SURE you are using the correct driver for your operating system version:
   * If you have applications built with XP/32 using 4.x packages, install the
     matching 4.x driver package
   * For new installations, or any installation where third-party software is or
     can be recompiled/re-linked with newer EDT libs, use the latest 5.x package

Software/Driver version 2.8 9/16/1998
- Major rewrite using optimized, streamlined code, scatter/gather device
  driver and many other changes.  IOCTL interface changed; if you are using
  direct IOCTL calls in your code they will likely still work, but a few
  may not. Either way, the 'C' library interface is strongly recommended
  over direct IOCTL calls. If you are upgrading and don't have a new manual,
  then there will probably be some new routines that aren't in your manual.
  You can download a new manual from the EDT web site or just peruse the
  library files (libpdv.c, libedt.c) and example programs (mainly take.c).

- pdv_open function prototype modified to accept just "pdv", NULL or
  INTERFACE (a #define in the header file) as first arg, unit number as
  second arg, e.g. "pdv_open(NULL, 0)". Old way will still works however
  ("/dev/pdvN"). PDV_LOCKDEV arg no longer applies, and will be ignored if
  specified.

- Several cameras added, including Hitachi KP-F100 and Kodak MEGAPLUS ES310.
